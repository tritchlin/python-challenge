# python-challenge
**Week 3 Python HW for UCSD Data Bootcamp**

Script files: PyBank/Main.py and PyPoll/Main.py

Both projects required:
- Import and read CSV, skip headers
- Display message in terminal 
- Print message to new text file in a separate folder from Main.py file
- Maintain running counts
- For Loops

**PyBank -**
- Analyze records for:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
- Unique syntax to this project includes:
  - Zip two lists into one dictionary
  - If/elif/else conditional statement
  - Setting locale for numerical formatting
  - Overriding locale settings for negative currency displays

**PyPoll -**
- Analyze records for:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote.   
    
- Unique syntax to this project includes:
  - Create empty dictionary and append variables within forloop
  - Formatting calculation to percentage with 2 decimal places visible
  - Create new defined function
  - "not in" syntax
  - Retrieving/printing multiple lines within an array through "join" function and "\n" formatting for new line creation
         
Additional personal goals:
- Minimize number of for loops used to minimize processsing time
- Keep all coding as dynamic as possible to account for future changes to data
- Maintain good documentation and readability of all assets
